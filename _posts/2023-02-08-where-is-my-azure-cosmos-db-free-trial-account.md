title: Where is my Azure Cosmos DB Free Trial account?
---

So you’ve signed up for the Azure Cosmos DB Free Trial and have an Azure account… but can’t find that free trial? Something to keep in mind about the Azure Cosmos DB Free Trial is that it is a **sandboxed** free trial. Sandboxed resources do not appear where your regular Azure resources appear.

1. In the Azure portal, in the upper right corner, select your profile icon. Then, select Switch directory.

2. From the directory list, select the **Switch** button for the directory named ***TryCosmosDBfor…***. In my example, it is **TryCosmosDBforPG**, which is trying Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.

If you want to know how much time you have left, the countdown timer will appear on your Azure Cosmos DB account.
