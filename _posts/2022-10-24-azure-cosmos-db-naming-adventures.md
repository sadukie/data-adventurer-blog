At Ignite 2022, Azure Cosmos DB had a lot of news – the big one being Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. The one that others may not have caught was the renaming of the APIs. These are the APIs for Azure Cosmos DB and how they map to old names:

|Old API Name |	New API Name  |	Use |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
|Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API |	Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL |	The core API for Azure Cosmos DB |
|Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB| Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB |	MongoDB workloads, document database |
|Azure Cosmos DB Cassandra API	| Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra |	Cassandra workloads, wide-column store |
|Azure Cosmos DB Table API |	Azure Cosmos DB for Table |	Migrating from Azure Table storage to Azure Cosmos DB |
|Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API |	Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin |	Graph data – understanding relationships within the data |
|— | 	Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL|	Distributed relational data, powered by the Citus open source extension |
