title: "A Gift for Learning to Use C# with Azure"
tags: cs-advent
---

I recently found out at the last minute that [the C# Advent Calendar](https://csadvent.christmas) was missing some gifts, and so I volunteered to bring on another. I will come back to my Gremlin posts and talk about filtering, aggregating, and sorting later. That deviates from C#. Instead, I want to introduce you to a gift I was shown these past couple months that I don’t think everyone knows about.

## Starting with the common gifts

I have to admit that I’ve learned a lot about Microsoft technologies over the years through their tutorials and quickstarts. These are some C# experiences for learning about C# and Azure.

- [Quickstart: Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin library for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin/quickstart-dotnet)
- [Quickstart: Use Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL with Azure SDK for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-dotnet)
- [Quickstart: Create your first C# function in Azure using Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-your-first-function-visual-studio
)
There’s a vast amount of links at: [Azure for .NET developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/).

Microsoft Learn is another one of my favorite places to learn on technologies. For those who are on Microsoft Learn and want to explore some learning paths with C#, these should be considered:

- [Microsoft Learn: Create serverless applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-serverless-applications/)
- [Microsoft Learn: Create cloud-native apps and services with .NET and ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-microservices-with-dotnet/)
- [Microsoft Learn: Architect modern applications in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/architect-modern-apps/)

## Do you have recommendations for C# + Azure resources?

This is just some of the few resources I wanted to share with the C# Advent community. However, I know there are more of you out there with treasured gifts to share as well. If you have a C# + Azure resource you’d like others to know about, leave a comment below!
